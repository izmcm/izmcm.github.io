I am a Software Engineer working with iOS fraud prevention at [AllowMe - Intelligence by Tempest](https://www.allowme.cloud/), graduated in iOS development at the Apple Developer Academy and a Computer Engineering student at UFPE :)

Currently focused on studying and researching more about security on iOS devices. Learning about operating system architecture and exploring iOS applications from new perspectives.
